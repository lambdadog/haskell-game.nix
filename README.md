haskell-game.nix
================

A framework for using Nix tooling for building and cross-compiling
fully statically linked executables written in Haskell. Specifically
intended for game development, but with a few tweaks can be used for
other applications as well.

(The part usable for other applications may be factored out in the
future)

This tooling uses IOHK's wonderful
[haskell.nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix)
framework and couldn't exist without it.
